## Overview
Ever since recently working at a maker space startup, I wanted to design and build a CNC machine. I had the opportunity
to build a 1000x1000mm X-Carve kit, which I may easily recommend for those just starting with DIY CNC.

## Goals

- Documented design, build & test results
- Open source software, based on either Grbl or Smoothieware
- Make use of locally available materials (where possible)
- < ZAR50 000 (about USD3,850) total budget

## Design

- Base & leveling hardware
- Linear motion bearings
- Electronics
- Software

## Build

The build shall be conducted as follows:

1. [Base]({{< ref "project/leanCNC/leanCNC-base.md" >}})
2. Y-axis
3. X-axis
4. Spindle
5. Controller & power supply
6. Base board & levelling

## References

I drew inspiration from the work of the following people:
