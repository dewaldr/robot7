The base of the CNC should provide a rigid, level, planar & vibrationless platform to mount the the moving parts of
the machine. My design assumes that the base & the floor it is standing on is imperfect, and provides methods for 
adjustment where the precision parts touch the base frame.

## Materials

I decided to build the base out of steel because it is my favourite material to work with and would,
provided I was careful, give me a strong, stable & light structure to build the rest of the machine on.


- 2x38x76mm rectangular steel tubing
- 2x38x38mm rectangular steel tubing
- 4x38x38mm flat steel
- 4 x M10 hex nut

## Cutting

I cut the steel with a standard abrasive cut-off (chop) saw. This is one of the least accurate 
methods of cutting as the cut is up to 4mm wide, generates a lot of heat leaves residure on the ends.

In future I would rather spend some money and get a cold cutting solution.

## Welding

Out of neccicity, I started welding with my old oil bath AC welder after my inverter welder broke. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my welds, which I ascribe to regular practise.

It is essential to first tack-join the corners of the frame before permanently welding the joins.

Tip: when weldeing square or rectangular tubing, only weld the top and the bottom of the join for a 
much cleaner appearance.


## Finishing

The frame was spray-painted with a coat of Rex Oxide primer 


## Levelling

## Summary

The final outcome, although not perfect, was really pleasing and provided a sufficiently level and square
platform for the remainder of the build.
