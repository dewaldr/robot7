The base of the CNC machine should provide a rigid, level, planar & vibration-free platform to mount the moving parts of
the machine. My design assumes that the base & the floor it is resting upon is imperfect, and provides methods for 
adjustment where the precision parts touch the base frame.

## Materials

I decided to build the base out of steel because it is my favourite material to work with and would,
provided I was careful, give me a strong, stable & light structure to build the rest of the machine on. 
The wall thickness of the steel tubing is actually not that important, but I chose the thicker 2mm 
version as it is easier to weld with a stick welder.

- 2x38x76mm (1½x3inch) rectangular mild steel tubing
- 2x38x38mm rectangular mild steel tubing
- 4x38x38mm mild steel flat bar
- 4 x M10 hex nut
- 2.5mm general purpose welding electrodes
- Cellulose spot putty
- 100 grit sanding paper
- Red oxide primer
- 4 x M10x55 Cone Foot 

**Note:** 38x76mm is approximately 1½x3inch

## Tools

- Tape measure
- Abrasive cut-off power saw
- Arc (stick) welder
- Welding magnets
- Large & small set-squares
- 115mm angle grinder
- Compressor & spray paint gun (optional)

## Cutting

I cut the steel with a standard abrasive cut-off (chop) power saw. This is IMHO one of the least accurate 
methods of cutting steel as the cut is up to 4mm wide, generates a lot of heat and leaves steel residue on 
the ends which have to be cleaned of with a file or angel grinder. The blade also tends to vibrate if you apply 
too much force.

In future I would rather spend some money and get a cold steel cutting solution.

## Welding

Out of necessity, I started welding with my old oil bath AC welder after my inverter (DC) welder broke. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my welds which I ascribe to regular practise repairing
farm equipment and making furniture.

It is essential to first tack-join the corners of the frame before permanently welding the joins.

**Tip:** When welding square or rectangular tubing, only weld the top and the bottom of the join (i.e. not the inside corners
of the join) for a cleaner result. It is also easier to clean up these welds with an angle grinder.

## Finishing

The somewhat crude tools I used to cut and weld the rectangular tube steel left unsightly gaps at some of the joins. I also
managed to burn through the tube wall in one or two places, leaving a rough patch that cannot be completely removed without
weakening the structure. To cover up these flaws I used a product called ***spot putty***, a quick-drying cellulose filler that can 
be shaped and sanded smooth when set. This trick only works if you paint your workpiece; galvanizing or powder coating won't stick
to the filler.

The base frame was first spray-painted with a coat of rust protective red oxide primer, followed by two coats of 2K automotive paint.

## Levelling

## Summary

The final outcome, although not perfect, was really pleasing and provided a sufficiently level, square and stable
platform for the remainder of the build.

## Lessons learned (and re-learned)

- Recently welded steel maintains heat for a long time. Handle with care if you want to avoid burns. Ouch!
- Steel is a wonderfully pliant, economical, strong and light material, and can be quite rewarding to work with.
- Sometimes it is convenient to change your design on-the-fly while building. Be sure to take the time to update your drawings/CAD model/etc.
