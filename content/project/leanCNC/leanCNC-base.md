The base of the CNC machine should provide a rigid, level, planar & vibration-free platform to mount the the moving parts of
the machine. My design assumes that the base & the floor it is resting upon is imperfect, and provides methods for 
adjustment where the precision parts touch the base frame.

## Materials

I decided to build the base out of steel because it is my favourite material to work with and would,
provided I was careful, give me a strong, stable & light structure to build the rest of the machine on. 
The wall thickness of the steel tubing is actually not that important, but I chose the thicker 2mm 
version as it is easier to weld with a stick welder.

- 2x38x76mm (1½x3inch) rectangular steel tubing
- 2x38x38mm rectangular steel tubing
- 4x38x38mm flat steel
- 4 x M10 hex nut

**Note:** 38x76mm = 1½x3inch

## Cutting

I cut the steel with a standard abrasive cut-off (chop) saw. This is one of the least accurate 
methods of cutting as the cut is up to 4mm wide, generates a lot of heat leaves residure on the ends.

In future I would rather spend some money and get a cold cutting solution.

## Welding

Out of neccicity, I started welding with my old oil bath AC welder after my inverter welder broke. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my welds, which I ascribe to regular practise.

It is essential to first tack-join the corners of the frame before permanently welding the joins.

**Tip:** When welding square or rectangular tubing, only weld the top and the bottom of the join (i.e. not the inside corners
of the join) for a cleaner result. It is also easier to clean up these welds with an angle grinder.

## Finishing

The base frame was first spray-painted with a coat of Rex Oxide primer, followed by a 2 coats of 2K automotive paint. 

## Levelling

## Summary

The final outcome, although not perfect, was really pleasing and provided a sufficiently level and square
platform for the remainder of the build.
